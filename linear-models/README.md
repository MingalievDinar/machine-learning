# Linear classifier

### Linear models are basic building blocks for many deep architectures, and stochastic optimization is used to learn models.

In [Linear models and optimization Jupyter Notebook](/Linear models and optimization.ipynb) implemented a linear classifier. It is trained using stochastic gradient descent modifications and numpy.

Precisly, there is solved a 2D classification problem with synthetic data.
