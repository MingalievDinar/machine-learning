# Machine Learning

Inspired by [Advanced Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) I decided to keep all Jupyter Notebooks related to deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language understanding, computer vision and Bayesian methods.

There are several topics:
* Deep Learning
	* [Linear models](https://github.com/MingalievDinar/machine-learning/blob/master/linear-models/README.md)
* Data Science Competition
* Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning
* Natural Language Processing
* Reinforcement Learning
* Deep Learning in Computer Vision
